# Misc Projects

Whatever doesn't warrant a new repo, but should still be saved.

## Table of Contents
  - [arduino-projects](https://github.com/tvarano54/misc-projects/tree/master/arduino-projects) are projects from high school for Arduino that I did for like a week
  
  - [flexible-resources](https://github.com/tvarano54/misc-projects/tree/master/flexible-resources/src/com/varano) are random java classes that I have with flexibility for multiple programs.
